        <h2>Black Coffee</h2>
        <p>Enjoy the pure essence of coffee with our classic black coffee. Black coffee - is simply a mixture of boiled water and a tablespoon of coffee without the addition of milk, sugar, or honey. For lactose-intolerant people, black coffee is a boon since there is no milk required to prepare it. This drink is high in terms of caffeine. Therefore, it must be consumed wisely to avoid the potentially harmful effects of caffeine on health.</p>

        <h2>Lungo Coffee</h2>
        <p>Lungo (lit. 'long') is a coffee beverage made by using an espresso machine to make an Italian-style coffee – short black (a single espresso shot) with more water (generally twice as much), resulting in a larger coffee, a lungo.
            A normal serving of espresso takes from 18 to 30 seconds to pull, and fills 25 to 30 millilitres, while a lungo may take up to a minute to pull, and might fill 50 to 70 millilitres. Extraction time of the dose is determined by the variety of coffee beans (usually a blend of Arabica and Robusta), their grind and the pressure of the machine. It is usually brewed using an espresso machine, but with two times the amount of water to the same weight of coffee, to make a much longer drink.

        <h2>CAppucino</h2>
        <p>Cappuccino, coffee drink made of equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and frothed milk, of probable Italian origin but influenced by an Austrian predecessor. Although a cappuccino is similar to a latte, the former is layered in three equal and distinct parts—with the foam typically spooned onto the drink in dollops—while the latter is a mixture of one part espresso and two parts poured steamed milk, with only a thin layer of foam on top. Because of its greater milk content, a latte is typically sweeter and higher in calories, fat, and protein.</p>
